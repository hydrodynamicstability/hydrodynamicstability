Data professional; physical scientist; scholar; critic.

I have an M.S. in applied statistics and a Ph.D. in physics from Purdue University.  I was a biostatistician from 2002-2024.  


<!--I am a permanent member of the American Physical Society (APS), American Geophysical Union (AGU), International Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA), Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  I am currently also a member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), American Statistical Association (ASA), and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).-->

A list of my selected publications and abstracts may be found [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/publicationlist/).  However, please note that the vast majority of my work (including code) is proprietary and will never be published.

I am slowly building a website to encourage physicists to learn some fluid mechanics, including resources to get started.  The (somewhat disorganized) prototype site may be found [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/Invitation-to-Hydrodynamics/).

Some perspectives on applied statistics that have influenced my thinking are assembled [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/Perspectives-on-Applied-Statistics/).  A slowly growing list of statistics quotes (thoughtful, entertaining, and outrageous) have been collected [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/statquotes/).

I consider myself a follower of Daniel, not Jacob, Bernoulli :-)

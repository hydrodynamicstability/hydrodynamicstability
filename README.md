### Christopher Tong's GitHub site

Data professional; physical scientist; scholar; critic.

I have an M.S. in applied statistics and a Ph.D. in physics from Purdue University.  I was a biostatistician from 2002-2024.  

I am proud to be a life member of the American Geophysical Union since 2012.

A list of my selected publications and abstracts may be found [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/publicationlist/).  However, please note that the vast majority of my work (including code) is proprietary and will never be published.

I am slowly building a website to encourage physicists to learn some fluid mechanics, including resources to get started.  The (somewhat disorganized) prototype site may be found [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/Invitation-to-Hydrodynamics/).

Some perspectives on applied statistics that have influenced my thinking are assembled [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/Perspectives-on-Applied-Statistics/).  A slowly growing list of statistics quotes (thoughtful, entertaining, and outrageous) have been collected [here](https://hydrodynamicstability.github.io/statquotes/).

I consider myself a follower of Daniel, not Jacob, Bernoulli :-)
